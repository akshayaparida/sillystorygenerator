# sillystorygenerator

This project covers several fundamental concepts in web development and JavaScript:

    DOM Manipulation: Interaction with HTML elements using JavaScript to dynamically update content based on user actions (button clicks, input changes).

    Event Handling: Responding to user actions (such as button clicks) by attaching event listeners (addEventListener) to HTML elements.

    String Manipulation: Using string methods (replace()) to modify text and replace placeholders with dynamically generated content.

    Arrays and Randomization: Storing data in arrays and selecting random elements from those arrays.

    Conditional Statements: Using if statements to execute code based on certain conditions (checking for user input or radio button selection).

    Basic Math Operations: Performing simple mathematical calculations for unit conversion (pounds to stones, Fahrenheit to Celsius).

    Functions: Defining and utilizing functions to encapsulate reusable pieces of code (e.g., randomValueFromArray()).

    Variable Scope: Understanding the scope of variables declared within different blocks of code.

    HTML/CSS Interaction: Updating HTML content and visibility based on JavaScript-generated data.

These concepts come together in a practical project where user input and selections dynamically modify the generated story's content and format.


pseudo- codes:

1. Gather references to HTML elements: 
   - customName = get element by ID 'customname'
   - randomize = query selector for button with class 'randomize'
   - story = query selector for paragraph with class 'story'

2. Define a function randomValueFromArray(array):
   - Generate a random number between 0 and the array's length minus one
   - Return the element in the array at the generated random index

3. Define storyText as a template with placeholders:
   - "It was 94 fahrenheit outside, so :insertx: went for a walk. When they got to :inserty:, they stared in horror for a few moments, then :insertz:. Bob saw the whole thing, but was not surprised â€” :insertx: weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day."

4. Define arrays insertX, insertY, insertZ with possible values for placeholders

5. Attach an event listener to the 'randomize' button:
   - When clicked, trigger a function called result()

6. Define the function result():
   - Generate random items xItem, yItem, zItem by calling randomValueFromArray() on insertX, insertY, insertZ respectively
   - Create newStory by replacing placeholders in storyText with xItem, yItem, zItem
   - If customName input is not empty:
     - Get the entered name and replace all occurrences of 'Bob' in newStory with the entered name
   - If the 'uk' radio button is checked:
     - Convert weightInPounds to weightInStones by multiplying pounds with a conversion factor
     - Convert temperatureInFahrenheit to temperatureInCentigrade using the Fahrenheit to Celsius formula
     - Replace occurrences of '94 fahrenheit' in newStory with temperatureInCentigrade and '300 pounds' with weightInStones
   - Display the generated story by updating the textContent of the story element and making it visible
